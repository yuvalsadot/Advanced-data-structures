# Advanced Data Structures Project 📚

A collection of advanced data structure implementations in Java, including an extended Skip List, various hashing functions, hash tables, and a custom-designed data structure.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project contains several major parts:
- **Indexable Skip List**: An extension of the classic skip list supporting efficient `rank` and `select` operations.
- **Hashing Functions**: Modular Hashing and Multiplicative Shifting Hashing implementations.
- **Hash Tables**: Separate chaining and open addressing (probing) methods for collision resolution.
- **Custom Data Structure**: Designed to support `insert`, `delete`, `contains`, `rank`, `select`, and `range` queries under specific complexity constraints.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Probability-based data structures
- Hashing theory
- Runtime and space optimization

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

Simply compile and run any of the Java classes using:
```bash
javac src/path/to/YourClass.java
java path.to.YourClass
```

## 🧠 Key Features
- Skip List with probabilistic height generation and fast search/update.
- Hash tables with different collision strategies and performance analysis.
- Efficient and scalable data structure design.
- Emphasis on modular and clean code architecture.

## ✨ Skills Demonstrated
