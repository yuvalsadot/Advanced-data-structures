# Advanced Data Structures Project 📚

A collection of advanced data structure implementations in Java, including an extended Skip List, various hashing functions, hash tables, and a custom-designed data structure.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project contains several major parts:
- **Indexable Skip List**: An extension of the classic skip list supporting efficient `rank` and `select` operations.
- **Hashing Functions**: Modular Hashing and Multiplicative Shifting Hashing implementations.
- **Hash Tables**: Separate chaining and open addressing (probing) methods for collision resolution.
- **Custom Data Structure**: Designed to support `insert`, `delete`, `contains`, `rank`, `select`, and `range` queries under specific complexity constraints.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Probability-based data structures
- Hashing theory
- Runtime and space optimization

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 installed
- A terminal/command line tool

### Compilation

Navigate to the `src/` directory and compile all Java files:

```bash
javac *.java
```
This will compile all classes at once.

## 🚀 How to Use
This project is a collection of Java classes for data structures and hashing experiments.
It does not include a default Main class to run directly.
You can:
- Write your own test classes that use these classes.
- Use the provided utilities (e.g., HashingExperimentUtils) to run experiments.
- Integrate these structures into other Java projects.
If you want a simple test yourself, you can write a new TestMain.java with a main() function that creates and tests these classes.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Skip List with probabilistic height generation and fast search/update.
- Hash tables with different collision strategies and performance analysis.
- Efficient and scalable data structure design.
- Emphasis on modular and clean code architecture.

## ✨ Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced Data Structures Implementation
- Algorithm Design and Analysis
- Java Object-Oriented Programming
- Hashing Techniques
- Space-Time Tradeoff Optimization
